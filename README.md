# A-beat-classifier-for-PPG-signals
Classifies each beat in PPG signals as Normal (N), Supraventricular (S), or Ventricular (V). Provides two classifications: (1) N vs. non-N and (2) N/V/S annotations for each systolic peak position. Includes confidence estimation for each classification and custom metrics to improve S and V detection accuracy.
